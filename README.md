# burger
Welcome to my burger application. This program displays my understanding of node.js, mysql, express, and express-handlebars. 
It is a full stack application: it transfers data from the client side, to the server side, then into a MySQL database, which then returns the data back to the user on the client side. It was developed solely by myself, Nicholas Ciambrone.
