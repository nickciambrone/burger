# burgerEater Application

Welcome to my "burger eater" application. This program displays my understanding of node.js, MySQL, express, and express-handlebars. It is a full stack application: it transfers data from the client side, to the server side, then into a MySQL database, which then returns the data back to the user on the client side. The user types in a burger name, and selects whether it has been 'devoured' or 'not devoured', then presses submit. The burger name is inserted into the MySQL database and then returned on the screen. If the user presses the devour button next to the burger, its "devoured" value in the database is switched to true. The 'devoured' burgers are displayed on the right and the 'not devoured' burgers are displayed on the left. The It was developed solely by myself, Nicholas Ciambrone.
